        <p>
I’m a French student studying math and informatics. I have always liked math, physics and informatics and I am especially passionate about computer graphics.        </p>
        <p>
        Back in highschool, I was playing to graph some weird functions and making programs for my calculator. So, I was amazed when I stumbled upon shadertoy and discovered the possibilities shaders (and math) offered.
        </p>

        <p>
Ever since I have been exploring this vast domain and many of the techniques employed in it. I’ve had a lot of fun with many personal projects. I am also interested in physics simulation and the fascinating results it is able to yield.
        </p>

        <p>
Aside from that, I started climbing when I was 10 years old (in Marseille’s calanques). I have continued since and have even participated in a few climbing contests.
