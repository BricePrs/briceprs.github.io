              <h6>Oct. - Nov. 2022 | html, css, javascript, WebGL</h6>
            </div>
            <p>I wasn't familiar with front end programing (nor interested) but I wanted to have a website to display my projects with a little bit more control than github allows. So I decided to make this website.</p>
            <p>I made it in roughly 3 weeks since I had to learn html/css and javascript as well as the specificity of WebGL compared to OpenGl 3.
              The background animation is entirely made with WebGl (and javascript of course).
              It is definitely far from being perfect and i guess the code could be cleaner (I'm not a javascript expert) but I don't wan't to spend to much time on it.
              I've also tried to make it work on mobile devices as well.
              However, the user experience is definitely better on computer (if you are on a mobile, check it out on your computer). </p>

            <p>I made this game with a friend during ludum dare 51 game jam.
              It was made using Unity in under 24 hours as our participation was a las minute decision (compared to 72 hours usually).

            <p>I made this program to select some points of a mesh. The goal was to have a fast python module that allow the user to move easily in the scene and select some points of the mesh.
            It supports two camera mode (absolute position and camera rotation OR fixed look at point). It is possible to switch between those two modes at any time.</p>

            <p>A basic raytracer implementation(on CPU) I've worked on in order to learn Rust</p>

            <p>This raytracer can handle spheres, depth of field and three types of material:<p>

            </div>
            <p>During this internship, I made an algorithm that filter a height map to generalise a terrain (see the before/after comparison below). </p>
            <p>For that, I used a software called Gratin designed by a member of the team I was in. This software allow to bind nodes.
              Each node takes some textures in input execute a shader by sampling the texture and output a texture.</p>
            <p>I have also worked on giving a "harsher" style to the shadows in order to mimic an artist style (Pierre Novat) whose son was helping the team (This effect can't be seen below).</p>
            <p>I've obviously encountered bugs during this internship and one of those was particularly interesting, so I also put it below.</p>
